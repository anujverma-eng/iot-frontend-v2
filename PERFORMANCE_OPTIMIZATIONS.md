# IoT Frontend Performance Optimizations

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Sensor Selection Race Conditions**
**Problem**: Multiple sensors appear selected when switching quickly between them.

**Solution**:
- Created `useDebouncedSensorSelection` hook with 150ms debouncing
- Added proper sensor selection state management with `currentSelectedSensor`
- Implemented request cancellation to prevent stale API calls

### 2. **Chart Data Performance Issues**
**Problem**: Loading 20k+ data points causes UI hangs and poor performance.

**Solutions**:
- **Data Sampling**: Optimized `LineChart` to sample large datasets (limit to 800 points for smooth rendering)
- **Improved Bucket Sizing**: Enhanced `chooseBucketSize` utility with mobile-specific optimizations
- **Mobile Detection**: Reduced target points to 250 on mobile devices for better performance

### 3. **State Management Optimizations**
**Problem**: Inefficient Redux state updates and multiple concurrent API calls.

**Solutions**:
- Created `useOptimizedDataFetch` hook with request throttling and cancellation
- Added proper loading state management with `currentSensorDataLoading`
- Implemented request deduplication to prevent duplicate API calls

### 4. **Loading State Improvements**
**Problem**: Poor loading experience with inconsistent loading indicators.

**Solutions**:
- Created `ChartLoadingSkeleton` for desktop loading states
- Created `MobileChartLoading` for optimized mobile loading experience
- Added loading overlays to sensor cards during data fetching

### 5. **Mobile Performance Enhancements**
**Problem**: Poor mobile experience with chart rendering and navigation.

**Solutions**:
- Mobile-specific chart loading components
- Optimized data point limits for mobile devices
- Better touch interaction handling

## Key Files Modified

### New Hooks
- `src/hooks/useDebouncedSensorSelection.ts` - Debounced sensor selection
- `src/hooks/useOptimizedDataFetch.ts` - Optimized data fetching with cancellation

### Enhanced Components
- `src/components/analytics/sensor-list.tsx` - Better selection state management
- `src/components/analytics/sensor-card.tsx` - Added loading indicators
- `src/components/visualization/chart-container.tsx` - Loading states and mobile optimization
- `src/components/visualization/line-chart.tsx` - Data sampling for performance

### New Loading Components
- `src/components/visualization/chart-loading-skeleton.tsx` - Desktop loading skeleton
- `src/components/visualization/mobile-chart-loading.tsx` - Mobile loading component

### Updated Core Files
- `src/pages/analytics.tsx` - Integrated optimized hooks and state management
- `src/store/sensorsSlice.ts` - Added current sensor data loading state
- `src/store/telemetrySlice.ts` - Mobile-aware bucket sizing
- `src/utils/bucketSize.ts` - Enhanced with mobile detection

## Performance Improvements

### Data Handling
- **Before**: Up to 20,000 data points rendered directly
- **After**: Intelligently sampled to ~800 points (250 on mobile)

### API Requests
- **Before**: Multiple concurrent requests, no cancellation
- **After**: Debounced requests with automatic cancellation

### Mobile Experience
- **Before**: Same performance characteristics as desktop
- **After**: Optimized bucket sizes and reduced data points for smooth mobile rendering

### Loading States
- **Before**: Generic spinners or no loading indication
- **After**: Contextual loading skeletons optimized for mobile and desktop

## Usage

The optimizations are transparent to existing code. The main analytics page automatically:

1. **Uses debounced sensor selection** - Prevents race conditions
2. **Optimizes data fetching** - Reduces unnecessary API calls
3. **Shows appropriate loading states** - Better UX during data loading
4. **Samples large datasets** - Maintains smooth chart rendering
5. **Adapts to mobile** - Provides optimized mobile experience

## Benefits

- **Reduced UI hangs** from large dataset rendering
- **Eliminated race conditions** in sensor selection
- **Improved mobile performance** with optimized data handling
- **Better user experience** with proper loading states
- **Reduced server load** through intelligent request management
